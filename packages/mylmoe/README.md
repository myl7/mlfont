## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate some required files to `public` in advance
npm run prebuild
# Build with Next.js
npm run build
# Next.js SSG, generate static files to `out`
next export
```

To enable SSR (not only SSG), follow Next.js doc to deploy the `out` dir
e.g. using a docker image or using a static serving service supporting SSR such as Cloudflare Pages

To change most personal config, just edit files in `config` folder

You may also want to edit files in `api` dir, which wraps HTTP API.
Replace the URLs to your own ones with you own impl.
