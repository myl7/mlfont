It is a pleasure to meet you!

I am myl7, an undergraduate currently of USTC in China, majoring in CS.
Chinese and English are both OK, so long as my poor English does not annoy you.

An open source enthusiast who is willing to open source all his code as long as he can.
As well as an active programmer on GitHub with more than one hundred commits every month recently.

An ACG fan who has watched about 200 animes, and unusually also has played about 100 galgames.
So do not be confused by the anime evaluation or galgame recommendation posts among computer science techniques.
